#  Simple Python Calculator

Hey there! 
This is a small Python project I worked on while learning **the basics of programming and data science**.  
It’s a simple **calculator** that does more than just math—it also compares numbers and plays with lists! 

---

## What This Project Does
- **Basic Math Operations** (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- **Logical Comparisons** (Greater than, Less than, Equal, etc.)
- **Lists & Data Handling** (Storing and accessing favorite items)
- **Prevents Errors** (No division by zero!)

## How to Run This Project
It’s super simple! Just download the script and run:

python
python simple_calculator.py
